     * types are defined here but subclasses are defined to provide
     * specialised error message and extra parameters (e.g. the byte
     * index where a JSON parsing error occured). For code that doesn't
     * need to know anything about the specific exception and just wants to
     * log an error message before exiting or continuing, catch exceptions
     * of this class and call what() to get some human readable English
     * text.
