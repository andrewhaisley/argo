     * \brief All json things are represented by instances of this class.
     *
     * All JSON things are represented by instaces of this class. Due to the nature of
     * JSON, which is fundamentally a construct of dynamically typed languages, there
     * are inevitably a few compromises and edge cases to be handled.<br>
     *
     * Refer to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC7159</a> for more
     * details.
     *
     * Notes on comparison operators: == and != are provided as the implementation
     * is complex and the semantics in the case of comparing one type with another are
     * simple - they're always not equal. <, <=, > & >= are not provided as a deliberate
     * policy as it's complex and not obvious what would be wanted when the types of the
     * two sides didn't match or were arrays/objects. The calling code is always free
     * to cast scalar types to numbers or strings where appropriate and compare those.
     *
     * E.g.
     *
     * \code{.cpp}
     * if (static_cast<int>(j1) < static_cast<int>(j2))
     * {
     *     // do something...
     * }
     * \endcode
